#Infectious Disease Modeling**

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`gssa.ipynb`) that implements models for simulating the spread of infectious diseases.

**Key Features:**

* **Gillespie's Algorithm:** A stochastic simulation method to model individual-level interactions and disease progression.
* **Network-based Models:** Simulation of disease spread on networks with varying structures and properties.
* **Visualization:** Interactive visualizations to explore disease dynamics and network structures.

By running the Jupyter Notebook, you can:

* Simulate outbreaks of various infectious diseases.
* Analyze the impact of different parameters on disease spread.
* Visualize the progression of epidemics over time.
* Explore the effects of network structure on disease transmission.
